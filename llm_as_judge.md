    Calls an internal /q analytics API with the provided analytics payload. 
    REMEMBER! try to apply all required the filters, dimensions, etc. in least amount of function tool calls.
    CAN do more calls if all the filters, dimensions, etc. in the query's context are not possible in a single call.

    USEFUL SYNONYMS:
      Revenue = Processed amount = GMV = total_amount (successful orders only)

      BNPL, Pay Later
      EMI, Instalments

    Args:
        domain: This will be provided by the info tool call.
        filters: A dict representing the 'filters' section with valid field values from the schema.
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - Using "limit" in Filters:
                -> If the query asks to *list* or *give* or *show* the possible values/enums of a "dimension", then **always** apply a limit = 10 for limiting the number of rows.
                -> Add 'limit' in the filter when the query requests to limit the number of rows by output, i.e., "top 'n'..." in the user query means apply limit as 'n'. However if the user is just asking for "top", then assume limit as 1.
                -> If the query contains "top 3", "top 2", "top", etc., ALWAYS APPLY 'limit' in the "filter". 
              - When querying for top values of a specific dimension (e.g., "top payment gateways"), always add a filter to exclude null values for that dimension. MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS FILTER OUT NULL VALUES, NOT EMPTY STRING "".
              - Consider Conversational Context: Carefully examine if the current user query is a continuation or refinement of a previous query. If the current query lacks specific filter details but appears to build upon earlier messages, actively infer the necessary filters from the established conversational context.
              - You are not allowed to use any field apart from the provided possible enum values in the JSON schema.
              - Do not return an empty filter object. After generating the filter, check each key and match it with the allowed JSON schema.
              - **CRITICAL**: Do not include a `filters` parameter at all if no dimension-based filters are needed. Only include `filters` when you actually need to filter on dimensions (raw data fields).
              - If the query asks details about a specific merchant, add the filter for merchant_id. (Note: merchant_id should be lowercase and without spaces).
              - If the query specifies EMI transactions, always set a filter for emi_bank to be not null.
              - To filter transactions for a specific card type (Credit Card/Debit Card), filter on "payment_instrument_group".
              - For UPI app payments, set payment_method_subtype to UPI_PAY. The UPI App name is stored in the "bank" field. 
              - For UPI handle/VPA/ID payments, set payment_method_subtype to UPI_COLLECT. The UPI handle is stored in the "bank" field.
              - For wallet transactions, set payment_method_type to WALLET. The wallet name is stored in the "bank" field.
              - When filtering on order success/failure, use the "payment_status" field. Supported values are ["SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "PENDING"]. For more granular status, use actual_payment_status.
              - For UPI on credit card transactions, NEVER filter `payment_instrument_group` = `CREDIT CARD`. ALWAYS use `is_upicc` = `true`.
              - Do not generate filters for time intervals. Time intervals are handled by the `interval` section of the payload.
              - When calculating success rate, do not apply a filter for `payment_status: SUCCESS`.
              - When asked about payment failure reason, refer to the `error_message` field.
        metric: This will be provided by the info tool call.
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - `total_amount` is for successful orders only (GMV).
              - `order_with_transactions_gmv` is for ALL orders (success, failed, pending, etc.). Do not use this for GMV.
              - Consider conversational context for follow-up queries. If a user asks for a trend after getting a metric, the metric should be carried over.
        dimensions: This will be provided by the info tool call.
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - **Critical Instruction**: Do not include `granularity`, `intervalCol`, or `timeZone` when the query asks for 'absolute values' (e.g., "How many?", "Top X?"). Only include these for 'trend over time' queries (e.g., "daily trend", "over time"). If the user asks for a "graph" or "chart", always treat it as a trend query and include granularity.
              - Default Time Range: If no time range is specified, use today from 12:00 AM to the current time with a `granularity` of "hour".
              - Time-Based Columns: Only use `order_created_at` as a value for `intervalCol`.
        interval: A dict with 'start' and 'end' keys (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - If the user doesn't explicitly mention the interval, assume the interval to be 12am of the same day to the current time. INTERVAL IS MANDATORY.
        sortedOn: (Optional) A dict specifying how to sort the results.
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - For any query that will return more than one row (i.e., whenever `dimensions` is non-empty and not limited to a single result), you **must** include a top-level `sortedOn` object outside of `filters`.
              - Use the first or most relevant metric from your `metric` list as the `sortDimension`.
              - Always set `"ordering": "Desc"`. 
              - The value for "sortDimension" MUST be a metric and can be "order_created_at".
        metric_filters: (Optional) A list of metric filter objects for filtering on aggregated metric values using 'having' conditions.
            IMPORTANT NOTES:
              - **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: Use `metric_filters` ONLY for filtering on METRICS (e.g., success_rate, total_amount). Use `filters` ONLY for filtering on DIMENSIONS (e.g., payment_gateway, card_brand).
              - Use `metric_filters` for queries like: "merchants with > 50,000 orders", "gateways with success rate < 80%", "transactions > $100K".
              - Use `filters` for queries like: "Razorpay transactions", "VISA cards", "failed payments".
              - Each metric filter object must contain a `metric`, `condition`, and `value`.
              - Available conditions: "Greater", "GreaterThanEqual", "Less", "LessThanEqual".
              - The `metric` field must be a valid metric name, and `value` must be numeric.
              - For percentage metrics (e.g., success_rate), values must be between 0-100.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the API response from the /q endpoint.

            <tool name="sr_analysis">
                <description><![CDATA[
    Checks if there has been a drop in Success Rate (SR) for a merchant for a given time range and filters (optional). Only use this tool if the user is specifically asking about a drop in success rate, investigating potential outages. Over any time period <= 7days use this tool for sr drop analysis in all cases instead of calling qapi tool.
    
    Args:
        sr_drop_filters: A List of dictionary representing the filters for SR drop analysis in the format "key": "...", "value": "...". This does not include 'merchant_id'. This includes payment dimensions such as:
            payment_gateway: Payment gateway name (e.g., "RAZORPAY", "PAYTM", "GOCASHFREE")
            ticket_size: Transaction amount range (e.g., "0-100", "1K-2K", "10K-50K")
            payment_status: Transaction status ("SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "PENDING")
            actual_payment_status: Detailed payment status (e.g., "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED", "CHARGED")
            auth_type: Authentication type (e.g., "THREE_DS", "OTP", "NO_THREE_DS")
            card_brand: Card network (e.g., "VISA", "MASTERCARD", "RUPAY")
            payment_method_type: Payment method (e.g., "CARD", "UPI", "WALLET", "NB")
            payment_method_subtype: Specific payment flow (e.g., "UPI_COLLECT", "UPI_QR")
            payment_instrument_group: Instrument category (e.g., "CREDIT CARD", "DEBIT CARD")
            is_tokenized: Boolean indicating if transaction used tokenization
            txn_flow_type: Transaction flow (e.g., "QR", "INTENT", "NATIVE")
            txn_type: Transaction type (e.g., "AUTH_AND_SETTLE", "ZERO_AUTH")
            txn_object_type: Object type (e.g., "ORDER_PAYMENT", "MANDATE_PAYMENT")
            txn_latency_enum: Transaction latency range (e.g., "0M-1M", "1M-2M")
            payment_flow: Payment flow (e.g., "CARD_3DS", "DIRECT_DEBIT")
            emi_type: EMI type (e.g., "NO_COST_EMI", "STANDARD_EMI")
            order_type: Order type (e.g., "ORDER_PAYMENT", "MANDATE_PAYMENT")
            is_upicc: Boolean indicating if UPI Credit Card was used
            is_emi: Boolean indicating if EMI was used
            bank: Bank name
            error_message: Error message for failed transactions
            gateway_reference_id: Gateway Reference Id through which the transactions were processed
        start_time: The start time for the analysis in UTC format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ". For relative time queries
            (e.g., "today", "last hour"), this is calculated based on the query.
            IMPORTANT: For "last X days" queries:
            - Calculate start_time as EXACTLY (current_date - (X-1) days)T00:00:00Z
            - Set end_time to the CURRENT timestamp
            - This gives exactly X days: today (partial) + (X-1) previous full days
            - NEVER calculate as (current_date - X days)
        end_time: The end time for the analysis in UTC format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ". For relative time queries,
                    this is typically set to 30 minutes before the current timestamp to avoid including in-progress transactions.
        entity_id: The merchant ID for the analysis.
             - If the user’s query payload contains `merchant_id` **or** the word “MERCHANT” appears in the conversational context or the merchant id is present in <user_context> of system prompt, automatically set `entity_id` to that value. Do not apply this merchant_id as filter.
             - Otherwise, **automatically extract and assume the merchant ID from the user query string if possible, instead of prompting for it.**

    Context Retention for Follow-up Queries: 
        - If the current query appears to be a follow-up to a previous SR drop analysis (e.g., asking "why" or requesting further details), RETAIN the `entity_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and all applicable `sr_drop_filters` from the previous query's context unless the current query explicitly specifies new values for them.
    
    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the full output of the checkSRDrop API along with parsed fields for explanation.

            <tool name="field_value_discovery">
                <description><![CDATA[
    Tool to discover candidate values for *only cardinality dimensions* via fuzzy matching.
    Note: Use this tool **only** when you need to look up possible field values to build filters without hard-coding lists.
    
    Supported Dimensions: All Dimensions **except** "merchant_id" and "error_message".
    DO NOT CALL THIS TOOL FOR *"merchant_id"* or *"error_message"*

    Notes:
        - Limit Enforcement:
          -> If default_limit > 50, return FieldLookupBatchResponse(error="default_limit cannot be greater than 50.")
        - Guards Loading:
          -> Load JSON from Langfuse prompt "high_cardinality_field_guards". On parse failure, raise RuntimeError("high_cardinality_field_guards prompt is not valid JSON").
        - Candidate Preparation:
          -> For each request, look up guards[dimension], filter out non-string or blank entries.
          -> Determine cap = request.max_results if given, else default_limit.
        - No Candidates:
          -> If the guard list is empty, return an empty list for each query (or a single empty list if no queries).
        - Fuzzy Matching:
          -> If queries provided: for each q, compute similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, q.lower(), c.lower()).ratio();
            -> Sort candidates by descending similarity, take top cap.
        - Default Ordering:
          -> If no queries: return the first cap candidates in their original order.
        - **Important Note on Absence of Results:**
          -> If a searched value is not found in the list of candidate values, it does *not* always mean that the value is unsupported for the given field. It could also indicate that there is currently no data recorded with that value for this particular field. Be sure to convey this to the user when communicating results—absence of a value in this lookup is not definitive proof that the value is invalid.

        - Response Structure:
          -> Returns FieldLookupBatchResponse with:
            • results: List[DimensionLookupResult], each containing:
                – dimension: string  
                – results: List[List[str]]  (outer list = per query, inner list = matched values)
            • error: optional string if limit validation fails

    Args:
        wrapper: Context for the function call
        requests: List of DimensionLookupRequest, each containing:
            • domain: This will be received from info tool.(Always call info tool before calling field_value_discovery)
            • dimension: string name of the field to look up (must be one of the Supported Dimensions)
            • queries: optional list of substrings to fuzzy-match (if empty or null, returns top values)
            • max_results: optional per-request cap (if null, uses default_limit)
        default_limit: global maximum number of values to return per query (must be ≤ 50)

    Returns:
        FieldLookupBatchResponse: 
            • results: List[DimensionLookupResult]
            • error: optional string if limit validation fails

            <tool name="juspay_get_order_details">
                <description><![CDATA[
Returns complete details for a given order ID. 

CRITICAL RETRY LOGIC: If you receive an error like "Order with id = 'xyz' does not exist", the provided ID is likely a transaction ID (txn_id) instead of an order ID. You MUST extract the order_id from the txn_id and retry the call.

Extraction patterns (ALWAYS follow these steps):
1. Remove the last '-' and number (e.g., '-1', '-2') from the end
2. If there's still a '-' and number at the end, remove that too (for silent retries)  
3. Take the part after the merchant prefix (usually after the first or second hyphen)

Examples:
- creditmantri-22087705-1 → 22087705
- paypal-juspay-JP_1752481545-1 → JP_1752481545
- zee5-6a45de15-6edd-4463-9415-f638a6709ee8-1 → 6a45de15-6edd-4463-9415-f638a6709ee8
- 6E-JFTWE26E7250714112817-1 → JFTWE26E7250714112817
- merchant-ORDER123-1-1 → ORDER123

MANDATORY: When you get "does not exist" error, immediately extract order_id using above patterns and call this tool again with the extracted order_id.
Key features:
- Fetches complete order details for a specific order ID (if txn_id provided extract order_id using above logic).
- Returns the amount in the major currency unit (e.g., rupees, dollars).
Use this tool to look up the status of a specific payment, troubleshoot a customer's order issue, verify transaction details for reconciliation, or fetch data for customer support inquiries. Essential for support teams, operations personnel, and developers who need to inspect the state of individual orders.

        <core_rules>
            <rule id="RULE_SR_TOOL_USAGE_POLICY">
                This is a two-part, critical rule for handling Success Rate (SR) queries:
                1.  **For Investigating DROPS (d7 days):** If the user's intent is to understand **WHY** SR is down or to analyze a **drop** (e.g., "Why did SR drop?", "Investigate the outage"), the assistant **MUST** use the `sr_analysis` tool for periods &lt;= 7 days. Using `q_api` for this purpose is a critical failure.
                2.  **For Reporting VALUES:** If the user simply asks **WHAT** the SR is (e.g., "What is the SR for today?", "Show me the SR for Visa"), the assistant **MUST** use the `q_api` tool. Using `sr_analysis` for simple reporting is incorrect.
                3.  **For periods > 7 days:** Even for SR drop analysis, use `q_api` instead of `sr_analysis`.
            </rule>
            
            <rule id="RULE_FILTER_DISCOVERY_POLICY">
    This rule applies to the sequence of tool calls involving `q_api`:
    
    1.  **field_value_discovery requirement:** The assistant **MUST** call `field_value_discovery` immediately before `q_api` for ANY dimension used in the q_api call, EXCEPT for the dimensions explicitly listed in the exceptions below. This applies even if the value looks exact. Skipping this for non-excepted dimensions is a procedural flaw.
    
    2. **CRITICAL DISTINCTION: DO NOT call `field_value_discovery` when merely using dimensions for breakdown/grouping instead of filtering for specific values.** For example, when asked to "Compare success rate of payment gateway" or "Break down by card_brand" without specifying which payment gateways or card brands, SKIP `field_value_discovery` as no specific value filtering is needed (TLDR: NO FIELD VALUE DISCOVERY CALL FOR ONLY DIMENSION/GROUPING REQUESTS).
  
    3.  **Array dimensions special handling:** For `entire_payment_flow` dimension, ALWAYS use "HasAny" or "HasAll" conditions as it contains array values.
    
    4.  **ABSOLUTE EXCEPTIONS - field_value_discovery is NEVER required for these dimensions:**
        - **merchant_id** - This dimension is ALWAYS exempt, regardless of how it's used (filter, grouping, dimension, sorting, etc.)
        - **error_message** - This dimension is ALWAYS exempt, regardless of how it's used (filter, grouping, dimension, sorting, etc.)
        - Any parameter where the value is `[null]`
        - merely using dimensions for breakdown/grouping instead of filtering for specific values.
        
    5. **IMPORTANT: Valid field_value_discovery dimensions**: For the following dimensions, field_value_discovery calls are VALID and should NOT be marked as incorrect: customer_id, order_created_at, udf1, udf2, udf3, udf4, udf5, udf6, udf7, udf8, udf9, udf10, order_amount, error_code, error_category, gateway_reference_id, date_created, amount, epg_txn_id, card_exp_month, card_exp_year, card_issuer_country, card_bin, card_last_four_digits, resp_message, mandate_frequency, txn_uuid, pgr_rrn. These dimensions are supported by the tool regardless of whether they return fuzzy-matched candidates or queried values directly.
    
    
    6.  **Clarification on "error_message":** If error_message appears ANYWHERE in a q_api call (as a dimension for grouping, as a filter value, in any parameter), field_value_discovery is NOT required. There is NO context where error_message requires field_value_discovery. This is an absolute, unconditional exception.
    
    7.  **Clarification on "merchant_id":** If merchant_id appears ANYWHERE in a q_api call, field_value_discovery is NOT required. This is an absolute, unconditional exception.

    
            </rule>
            
            <rule id="RULE_LIMIT_ENFORCEMENT">
                For `q_api` calls with grouping/ranking dimensions:
                1.  **Default limit:** Apply limit of 100 unless user specifies otherwise
                2.  **Top N queries:** If user asks for "top N", apply limit: N
                3.  **Singular vs Plural:** Top SINGULAR data (top error message) = limit 1; top PLURAL data (top error messages) = limit 100
                4.  **Limit placement:** Apply limit on the grouping/ranking dimension itself, not on unrelated filters
                5.  **Sorting:** Apply descending sort on main metric (`order_with_transactions` for listing queries)
            </rule>
            
            <rule id="RULE_SCHEMA_ADHERENCE">
                The parameters used in tool calls must match the tool's defined schema. Using a non-existent field for a filter is a critical error.
                The field order_id is a valid metric and should not be flagged as invalid when used in metric context.

            <rule id="RULE_ERROR_HANDLING">
                1.  **Tool failures:** If any tool call fails with an error response, this represents a critical failure
                2.  **Validation errors:** On pydantic/validation errors, the assistant should auto-correct and retry exactly once
                3.  **Merchant_id handling:** merchant_id filter should NOT be added to q_api payload unless user explicitly requests it

            Please review the conversation. Your focus **must be only on the section labeled "--- Current Turn to Judge ---"**. Use the "--- Conversation History ---" section only for context. Evaluate the assistant's action in the current turn against the agent's guidelines and formulate your response as a single, valid JSON object.
            IMPORTANT :  Do note a point that a query is asked some time before this evaluation takes place , So based on timestamp correctly analyze the queries and do not mark incorrect just because the query was asked before what the current timestamp is.

            <principle>
                The final verdict is determined by adherence to critical rules and the factual accuracy of the assistant's answer. A minor procedural misstep does not fail the entire conversation if the final answer is correct. Only critical rule violations always result in INCORRECT, regardless of final answer accuracy.

            <thought_process>
                0.  **Pre-check for false positives on RULE_FILTER_DISCOVERY_POLICY:**
                    - If the ONLY dimensions used without field_value_discovery are merchant_id and/or error_message, this is NOT a violation
                    - These dimensions are ABSOLUTELY exempt in ALL contexts - no field_value_discovery is ever required
                    - Do NOT mark as INCORRECT for missing field_value_discovery if only merchant_id or error_message are involved
                1.  **Check for critical rule violations first:**
                    - Wrong tool choice for SR queries (RULE_SR_TOOL_USAGE_POLICY)
                    - Tool call failures or API errors (RULE_ERROR_HANDLING part 1)
                    - Schema violations (RULE_SCHEMA_ADHERENCE)
                    
                2.  **Check for self-corrected field_value_discovery:**
                    - Did the assistant initially fail to call `field_value_discovery` before `q_api` but then corrected the mistake by calling `field_value_discovery` and then `q_api` correctly in a subsequent step? If so, this is not a critical violation.

                3.  **If critical violations found (and not self-corrected):** Mark as INCORRECT and state the specific rule violated
                
                4.  **If no critical violations:** Check procedural best practices:
                    - Proper limit enforcement (RULE_LIMIT_ENFORCEMENT)
                    - Correct handling of array dimensions with HasAny/HasAll
                    - Appropriate merchant_id handling
                    
                5.  **Determine final verdict:**
                    - INCORRECT: Any uncorrected critical rule violation OR factually wrong final answer
                    - CORRECT: No uncorrected critical violations AND factually accurate answer (minor procedural issues noted but don't fail)
                
                6.  **Formulate reason:** - INCORRECT: State the critical error/rule violation
                    - CORRECT with procedural issues: "Answer was factually correct, but [specific procedural issue]"
                    - CORRECT with self-correction: "Answer was factually correct. Assistant initially missed a `field_value_discovery` call but self-corrected."
                    - CORRECT with no issues: "Assistant followed all critical rules and provided accurate results"
                7.  **Tool Equivalency Context:**
                    - Tools with "_jaf" suffix are functionally equivalent to their non-"_jaf" counterparts and should be treated identically for evaluation purposes:
                        - `q_api_gemini_jaf` ≡ `q_api` ≡ `q_api_gemini`
                        - `field_value_discovery_jaf` ≡ `field_value_discovery`
                        - `sr_analysis_jaf` ≡ `sr_analysis`
                        - `math_jaf` ≡ `math`
                        - `rag_tool_jaf` ≡ `rag_query`
                        - `mid_lookup_tool_jaf` ≡ `mid_fuzzy_lookup`
                        - `kam_lookup_jaf` ≡ `kam_lookup`
                        - And similarly for all other tools with "_jaf" suffix
                    - When evaluating tool usage, consider the functional purpose rather than the exact tool name. Do not mark responses as INCORRECT solely based on "_jaf" vs non-"_jaf" tool naming differences.
                    - The same rules, requirements, and best practices apply regardless of whether the "_jaf" or non-"_jaf" version of a tool is used.
                8. The field order_id is a valid metric and should not be flagged as invalid when used in metric context.
